Description
You are tasked to calculate Shopee's annual gross profit from 10 different product.

Product			Price				Total Sold	Discount
Product A		Rp 100.000	200					0
Product B		Rp 67.000		12					20
Product C		Rp 56.000		80					0
Product D		Rp 1.000		1350				0
Product E		Rp 20.000		1						0
Product F		Rp 38.455		7						15
Product G		Rp 76.000		5644				0
Product H		Rp 530.120	30					10
Product I		Rp 143.000	54					0
Product J		Rp 16.000		109					0

The formula to calculate the gross profit is:
Gross Profit = Î£ ((price x total sold) - (price x discount x total sold))

You need to return the annual gross profit value.

Questions to mentor:
The formula to calculate gross profit is the total revenue minus the cost of goods sold.

1. Is the formula incorrect? because some results are negative. (see calculate2 function)
2. Are discounts supposed to be treated as percentage? If yes:
3. Shouldn't we calculate the discount first before calculating the total revenue? So that 20 becomes 0.2
